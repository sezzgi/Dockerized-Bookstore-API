# Dockerized Bookstore API

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a modern, containerized web application using industry-standard DevOps practices. I created a RESTful Bookstore API that allows users to manage their book inventory through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Technical Highlights

- **Containerized Architecture**: Built with Docker and Docker Compose for consistent deployment and scalability
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated AWS infrastructure deployment using Terraform
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Python Flask for the API, MySQL for data persistence
- **Cloud-Native**: Deployed on AWS EC2 with proper security configurations
- **RESTful Design**: Full CRUD operations for book management (add, view, update, delete books)

## Why This Matters
This project showcases my ability to:
- Build production-ready containerized applications
- Implement infrastructure as code practices
- Deploy secure cloud applications
- Design RESTful APIs following best practices
- Work with modern DevOps tools and workflows
